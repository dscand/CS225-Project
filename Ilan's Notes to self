First, Read the website below. 
        https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/21_sound_effects_and_music/index.php
                        void close()
                        {
                                //Free loaded images
                                gPromptTexture.free();

                                //Free the sound effects
                                Mix_FreeChunk( gScratch );
                                Mix_FreeChunk( gHigh );
                                Mix_FreeChunk( gMedium );
                                Mix_FreeChunk( gLow );
                                gScratch = NULL;
                                gHigh = NULL;
                                gMedium = NULL;
                                gLow = NULL;
    
                                //Free the music
                                Mix_FreeMusic( gMusic );
                                gMusic = NULL;

                                //Quit SDL subsystems
                                Mix_Quit();
                        }
                this will now lay all ground work to allow our sound effects to play at specific times. 
                now, all we will need to do is go into all the cases for actions, such as movement and button clicks, and add a sound effect to that
                For example, the rocket while moving forward with input shows a flame texture. we also need to play a rocket sound for when the engines is ignited. 
                when and explosion happens, we need a sound to play for the duration of animation. lastly, button presses should have a click sound and gravity wells have a quite pulsing sound.
                and a main menu theme.       
                        
                        
Next, grab a sample sound for testing and work on the implimentation of the sound

after, do sound design after the code compiles and runs with a sample texture. 



Start Presentation

make sure project meets project requirements:
 exceptions
 a UML diagram
 Submit a style guide and made sure to follow it with all your submitted code. 
 10-15 minutes long.  Presentations will take place during class time.  Correctly use C++ 
vocabulary words during your presentation (ex. virtual function, abstract base class, 
overloading, overriding, scope resolution operator).
